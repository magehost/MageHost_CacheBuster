## MageHost_CacheBuster
Fix for JS and CSS files being cached in visitor's browser cache.

**We are sorry but we cannot offer customer support for this extension, and it is provided "as-is" for free. We use it at a number of big shops and it works well.**

### Config Settings:

`System > Configuration > GENERAL > MageHost.pro: Cache Buster for JS and CSS`
